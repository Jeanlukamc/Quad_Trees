# Quad_Trees
Representation of how Quad Trees work

- Within this project I simulate with the use of graphs how Quad Trees are able to locate multiple points within a graph and isolate them by recursively dividing into 4 smaller quadrants. It repeasts this process until every point is isolated in a single square.
- The size of the squares is redundant in this case. What is being tested and shown is how it effectively isolates points by efficiently partitioning the 2D space into smaller and manageable regions.
- With this recursive division, the location of points in a region eliminates large portions of the search space and can quickly narrow down the search by the navigation of each node.
